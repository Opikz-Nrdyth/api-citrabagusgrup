A baby blue whale, just born, can be 23 feet long and weigh 30 tons.<br>Although whales live in the oceans and swim like fish, they are not fish. They are mammals, like cows and elephants. Unlike fish they bear their young alive, not as eggs. Their babies live on their mother's milk. They breathe through their lungs and hold their breath when they go underwater. If they cannot come to the surface to breathe fresh air, they will drown. Further more, they are warm-blooded. Fish, however, lay eggs, breathe oxygen in the water, and are cold-blooded.<br>Whales live in all the oceans. In the win-ter some of them go to warm waters to feed. There are two kinds of whales, whales with teeth (toothed whales) and whales without teeth (baleen whales). The toothed whales eat fish and squid, which they can catch with their teeth, although they swallow their food without chewing it. The baleen whales eat plankton (small sea animals and plants). When they find plankton, they open their mouths and swim into the plankton. When they close their mouths they squeeze out the water and swallow the plankton.<br>Whales have few enemies.
