The main part<br>which is brownish yellow to reddish brown<br>is easily distinguished from the whiteish<br>gray part. Teak wood is beautifully<br>decorative because it has a clear growing<br>circle - slightly dense and oily - that can be<br>seen from different angles. Teak wood is<br>easily shaped, either by machine or by hand<br>tools. If the tools used are sharp enough,<br>teak processing can be done until it is<br>smooth. However, processing the wood<br>must be carefully carried out because it is<br>vulnerable. <br><\/p><p>Teak wood is anatomically<br>characterized as follows. The pores are<br>round to oval. The porous part contains<br>tylosis and white deposit. The wood\u2019s<br>paratracheal parenchyma is a thin sheath<br>which in the early wood is rather wide and<br>later forms a marginal band. The<br>apotracheal parenchyma rarely forms a<br>chain of about 4 cells.<br><\/p><p>One of the amazing uses of teak is<br>its ability to withstand all kinds of weather<br>conditions. Furniture used for the exterior<br>does not require paint or varnish.<br>Snowstroms, heavy rain, and tropical heat<br>cannot beat the strength of teak wood. Teak<br>wood is one of the few woods in the world<br>that has natural oils to ward off water and<br>keep the wood from wrinkling, cracking or<br>breaking. Teak wood is very resistant to<br>weathering and is naturally resistant to<br>termites. <br><\/p><p>To obtain super-quality teak, it all<br>begins with hunting for teak trees which are<br>about 600 kinds in number. The beginning<br>step is choosing teak seed stands. This step<br>identifies good seed stands. Of the several<br>identified good seed stands, the stands that<br>will likely grow well are selected. Then, to<br>grow the selected teak seed stands further,<br>a plot of stands can chosen and assigned as<br>a Seed Production Area (APB).<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>1.

The planet itself is a gas giant, but the Forest Moon of Endor is a world where small hairy creatures can live. Even though we do not live in the Star Wars world, astronomers are now finding the first evidence of a moon orbiting a large gas planet is a star system outside our solar system. <br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>A recent study published in Science Advances reports existence of signs of exomoon orbiting at Kepler-1625b, which is exoplanet about the size of Jupiter. This planet surrounds the yellow parent star every 287 days at the same distance as the Earth orbits the Sun. Therefore, the planet and the moon may be in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d of the star, with equilibrium temperatures probably reaching 300-350 Kelvin (27-2270 C). <br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>However, before we get too excited about the prospect of finding Ewok, it should be noted that exomoon which is officially named Kepler-1625b-i has a radius of about four times that of Earth and a mass about 16 times that of our planet, or the size and mass of the planet Neptune. Therefore, it is not possible that exomoon has a solid surface and is likely to have a very gas-filled body, like the planets that surrounds every 22 days. This exoplanet was originally discovered by employing transit techniques. When a planet passes in front of its parent star, along the line of sight of researches, the brightness of a star fades slightly (about 1% for a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a sun-sized star) in each orbit. So, the decrease in star brightness is a sign of planets outside the solar system.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Obviously, a moon outside the solar system can contribute to its own additional transit signal, but for an object that is proportional to the size of the Earth\u2019s moon, additional dimming will only be an amount to about ten parts per one million. This makes the moon difficult to detect. Also, this is further complicated by the fact that the moon\u2019s signal will also be in a different location due to the rotation of the planet around it at all times. Thus, the lunar transit will not recur strictly, and a few months around one planet can obscure the signal.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>22.
