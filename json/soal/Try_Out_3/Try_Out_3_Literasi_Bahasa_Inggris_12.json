Every morning, he sold them along the roadside near the market. His mangoes were big, juicy, sweet and fragrant. Although he sold them at a high prince, a lot of people bought from him. Eventually, he grew very haughty and conceited as his sales picked up. <br>\n\u2002\u2002One Sunday morning, a hold dirty beggar wearing scruffy and smelly clothing stood in front of the mango stall. He begged the hawker for one mango. The beggar said politely, \u201cSir, I have not eaten a mango since I was ten. Can you please spare me just one fruit?\u201d the proud hawker didn\u2019t even give him a wink but continued to shout, \u201cMangoes! Mangoes!\u201d <br>\n\u2002\u2002As the beggar stood right in front of his stall, other people had to move (further) away from the stall to avoid the beggar, and that affected the hawkers business. <br>\n\u2002\u2002Finally, the hawker got very angry and pushed the beggar away. In doing so, the old beggar tripped and slipped on a puddle of dirty water. A housewife who saw the incident felt sorry for the beggar and gave him a mango. The beggar was very touched and kept on saying. \u201cThank you\u201d over and over again. He told the crowd that he was going to share the mango with them. <br>\n\u2002\u2002He borrowed a knife from the butcher a few stall away, cut the mango in to smaller pieces and shared them with the people there. As for the big mango seed, the beggar dug a hole in the ground and buried the seed. Then, he asked the young butcher to give him some water to water the seed. After that, the beggar uttered some words. To everyone\u2019s surprise, a small sprout shot up and rapidly grew into a mature mango tree bearing big, sweet, juicy and fragrant mangoes all over the tree. The beggar then plucked the fruit and gave them away to the people. <br>\n\u2002\u2002The arrogant hawker left his own stall and joined the crowd to watch the beggar performing this miracle. After all the mangoes were given away to the people, the beggar walked into the crowd and disappeared. The proud hawker walked back to his stall and screamed, \u201cWho stole all my mangoes?\u201d <br>\n\u2002\u2002Finally, he realized that all the mangoes growing on that tree actually belonged to him. The beggar, who was actually a high priest, had wanted to teach him a lesson. From that day onwards, this once haughty and conceited hawker became a humble and charitable person. <br><br><strong>9.<\/strong> Why did people still buy mangoes from the hawker despite his high price ?<br><\/p>",

The doctor, from Evelina Children's Hospital in London, said every new mode 5 l was \"bluer and brighter\". He said manufacturers needed to show more \"responsibility\". <br>\n\u2002\u2002As it gets darker in the evening, the body starts to produce the sleep hormone melatonin - which helps people nod off. Certain wavelengths of light, those at the blue-green end of the spectrum, can disrupt the system. <br>\n\u2002\u2002Professor Gringras was part of a study, published in Frontiers in Public Health, analysing the light emitted by devices. It concluded there was a clear trend for new devices to be bigger, brighter, have higher levels of contrast and 10 emit more blue light. The professor of children's sleep medicine told the BBC News website: \"That is great for use in the  day, but awful for use at night. <br>\n\u2002\u2002\"There is converging data to say if you are in front of one of these devices at night-time it could prevent you falling asleep by an extra hour.\" <br>\n\u2002\u2002He said some sleep-aware apps had already been designed to reduce blue-green light emissions. And that a 15 bedtime mode could automatically filter out the blue as software such as flux already does. He said there needed to be \"more responsibility from 15 manufacturers\" and the \"key is to automate it\".<br>\n\u2002\u2002Professor Gringras added: \"It is not good enough to say do less and accept this is the world we live in, they are fun devices but we do need some protection on what they do at night-time.\" <br>\n<br><strong>15.<\/strong> The passage mainly discusses a topic on ...<br><\/p>",
