In recent years, experimentalists have published data suggesting that the results of earlier labora- tory experiments were not caused by loss aversion but by other factors. By making a few changes to the experimental design-such as better training subjects in the auction mechanisms used in the experiments, changing the way subjects were given the items, and modifying the procedures for eliciting choices-to rule out alternative explanations, experimentalist were able to make \"endow- ment effects that had been observed in the laboratory disappear.Many other researchers have since replicated these results. The new data suggest that ownership alone is not enough to change people's expressed preferences.These results have led experimental economists and cognitive psychologists to develop alternatives to endowment theory.<\/p><p>The economists ascribing to the theory of en- dowment effect would consider which one of the following as an example of this effect?<\/p><p> <\/p>",

China is Africa's biggest trading partner, with twoway trade growing twentyfold in the past two decades to US$204 billion last year, according to China's Com- merce Ministry.

Furthermore, exercise regulary makes our body stronger and improves its endurance. Physical activity also conditions our cardio- vascular system, which helps keep our muscle energized by delivering oxygen more efficiently. As a result, we will have more energy to do everyday tasks.

While Spider-Man uses the threads to zigzag from building to building, or to snare a bad guy, scientists are investigating silk for different reasons. Though researchers have learned a lot about silk by investigating spiders, insects such as caterpillars, ants and bees also have been studied for the sticky stuff. Scientists are even trying to get silk from animals such as goats. \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;It turns out silk might be good for weaving a lot more than shirts and ties. In the future, the silky fiber might be used to make supertough bulletproof vests and light but strong parachute cords. Silk also might work well for delicate tasks inside the body. Researchers are experimenting with using silk to support growing cells, the same way a construction crew builds scaffolding around a building to help keep everything in its place during construction. Spider silk is an ideal material, according to a researcher from University of Wyoming, but humans havebeen gathering silk not from spiders but from silkworms for hundreds of years. But silkworm silk has its problems. A silkworm covers its silk in sticky glue that holds the cocoon together. Sometimes humans have a bad allergic reaction to this glue. \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;Spiders, on the other hand, don't use sticky glue. Most spiders have an abdomen made up of five different sections. The last two sections are where the silk-making happens. These sections of the lower belly are modified into special structures called spinnerets, which are sort of like faucets for silk. The silk is mixed in glands and then secreted out of the spinnerets. Spiders can't shoot silk out for long distances the way Spider-Man does. Instead, they attach the emerging silk to something. like a tree branch, and then move away from the branch. This pulls the silk outward. \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;The main ingredient in spider silk is proteins, and there are many different kinds, depending on which spider is spinning and which silk it wants to make. Some of the proteins are very large and complicated, and therefore hard to make a lot of in the lab. So some scientists have put the genes that have the instructions for making silk into other creatures, such as goats. The silkmaking genes are turned on only in the goat cells that make milk, so when these goats are milked, there is silk in the milk. However, a liter of milk may have only 15 grams of silk, which means it would take about 600 gallons of milk to make one bulletproof vest. At higher concentrations the milk starts clumping. perhaps because the silk proteins are sticking to milk proteins.<\/p><p>An appropriate title for the text is...<\/p>",

For instance, we seize a man and deliberately do him a malicious injury: say, imprison him for years. One would not suppose that it needed any exceptional clearness of wit to recognize in this an act of diabolical cruelty. But in England such a recognition provokes a stare of surprise, followed by an explanation that the outrage is punishment or justice or something else that is all right, or perhaps by a heated attempt to argue that we should all be robbed and murdered in our beds if such senseless villainies as sentences of imprisonment were not committed daily. It is useless to argue that even if this were true, which it is not, the alternative to adding crimes of our own to the crimes from which we suffer is not helpless submission. Chickenpox is an evil; but if I were to declare that we must either submit to it or else repress it by seizing everyone who suffers from it and punishing them by inoculation with smallpox, I should be laughed at; for though nobody could deny that the result would be to prevent chickenpox to some extent by making people avoid it much more carefully, and to effect a further apparent prevention by making them conceal it very anxiously, yet people would have sense enough to see Dipindai dengan CamScanner that the deliberate propagation of smallpox was a creation of evil, and must therefore be ruled out in favor of purely humane and hygienic measures. Yet in the precisely parallel case of a man breaking fan into my house and stealing my diamonds I am expected as a matter of course to steal ten years of his life. If he tries to defeat that monstrous retaliation by shooting me, my survivors hang him. The net result suggested by the police statistics is that we inflict atrocious injuries on the burglars we catch in order to make the rest take effectual precautions against detection; so that instead of saving our diamonds from burglary we only greatly decrease our chances of ever getting them back, and increase our chances of being shot by the robber. \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the thoughtless wickedness with which we scatter sentences of imprisonment is as nothing compared to the stupid levity with which we tolerate poverty as if it were either a wholesome tonic for lazy people or else a virtue to be embraced as St. Francis embraced it. If a man's indolent, let him be poor. If he is drunken, let him be poor. If he is not a gentleman, let him be poor. If he is addicted to the fine arts or to pure science instead of to trade and finance, let him be poor. If he chooses to spend is wages on his beer and his family instead of saving it up or his old age, let him be poor. Let nothing be done for \"the undeserving\": let him be poor.
